# covid-youtube-api
My code from the COVID YouTube Analytics project at Mac-Theobio.
This is a utilization of the YouTube API v3 to get COVID-related data. 
This is still a work-in-progress; lots of hardcoded values and kludge to clean up.

This project proposes to analyze misinformation and trends in views on COVID through looking at the content of YouTube videos. 
It also seeks to compare differences between popular common videos and videos from public health sources such as the WHO. 

More details will be described as the project progresses.
